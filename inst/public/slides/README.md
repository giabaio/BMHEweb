# STAT0019 (Bayesian methods in health economics) 
## Academic year 2021/2022 (Jan-Mar term)

Welcome to the GitHub repository for STAT0019 (Bayesian Methods in Health Economics). This repository will host all the relevant material that will be made available every week. You can connect to the GitHub (but only if you have registered for the module!), which means you'll be allowed to use it directly (e.g. by "forking" the repo) or simply by downloading all the files onto your computer.

As you can see, this module essentially is made of two halves - the first main topics is Bayesian modelling; the second is its application to health-economic evaluation. These two will be intertwined throughout the module - we will switch back and forth to the description of the methods and their application to data on cost-effectiveness of (mainly, but not exclusively) pharmaceutical interventions. If you are interested in health economics (as, clearly, the students in the MSc Health Economics & Decision Science, HEDS), this is pretty much what you are likely to do for a living. If you're not, then the topics are very relevant anyway - Bayesian modelling can be applied to topics as varied as the [prediction of football results](http://www.statistica.it/gianluca/project/football/), whether there is [bias in the tele-voting at the Eurovision context](http://www.statistica.it/gianluca/project/eurovision/), the modelling and prediction of the [outcome of the general elections](http://www.statistica.it/gianluca/post/2019-12-12-better-late-than-never/), to name a few...

## Reading material
Every week, I will point out clearly relevant textbooks and other material for you to complement the lectures. The main textbooks are the following:

- Baio G (2012). [Bayesian Methods in Health Economics](http://www.statistica.it/gianluca/book/bmhe/) (available from UCL Library)
- Baio G, Berardi A, Heath A (2017). [Bayesian Cost-Effectiveness Analysis with the R package BCEA](http://www.statistica.it/gianluca/book/bcea/) (available from the UCL Library)
- Lunn D, Jackson C, Best N, Thomas A, Spiegelhalter D (2012). [The BUGS Book](https://www.mrc-bsu.cam.ac.uk/software/bugs/the-bugs-project-the-bugs-book/) (available from the UCL Library)
- Baio G (2019). [Introduction to statistical concepts](https://gianluca.statistica.it/teaching/intro-stats/Notes.pdf)

There are other relevant texts that I will point out to. But it is good to familiarise with the National Institute for Excellence and Health Care (NICE) Decision Support Unit ([DSU](http://nicedsu.org.uk/)) Technical Support Documents ([TSD](http://nicedsu.org.uk/technical-support-documents/technical-support-documents/))
